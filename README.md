<h1>MODLE3-JavaScript-Conditionals</h1>

I made this assignment in VSCode and I followed the "Theme idea". I think that I got a better understanding about conditionals because I didn't follow any tutorials for this one, ofcorse I had to Google many things to get answers but I'm still prout of this. :) P.S. You can open this code in VSCode and run it through terminal or run it through replit.com.
